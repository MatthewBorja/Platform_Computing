                <p> 
                    Greetings! I am Matthew Borja. I was born in La Palma, California. I spent most
                    of my childhood growing up in Moreno Valley. I went to Canyon Springs High School
                    and graduated in 2015. I attended Riverside City College part-time while I built
                    up funds, never wanting to give up on my dreams and aspirations, I completed my
                    Associate's Degree in 2022. I transferred to California State University, San 
                    Bernardino in the Fall of 2022 where I kicked it into high-gear and started as a 
                    full-time student! This is my last semester! I owe so much to my wife, she 
                    supported me through these trials and tribulations, her belief in me to succeed 
                    has brought me to where I am today. I will be graduating with a B.S. Computer Science
                    when this semester finishes!
                </p>

                    I decided to register for this class, because although I feel quite proficient
                    with C++, I would like to build up my proficiencies with other languages and libraries
                    that are quite sought-after by employers, such as JavaScript. Web development intrigues 
                    me and I'm really excited for what's in store this semester! Having a better grasp of
                    JavaScript will enable me to utilize my knowledge of MySQL to build powerful applications!
                    For my overall skillset, I would say I am confident with C++, getting acquainted with Java, 
                    actively learning JavaScript, continuously learning the ins-and-outs of Structured Query 
                    Languages, and building up my capabilities with HTML and CSS.

                    As for my hobbies, I like to game on PC. I was fortunate that my family had one of those
                    clunky gray desktops running Windows 98. That's where my computer science path started.
                    Just like all kids, I became familiar with technology better than my parents. I got into
                    Warcraft III because my dad was a fan of the older games. It was around the time I was
                    entering High School that I realized my affinity for computers could become a career.
                    My early computer science courses at RCC revealed how amazing it felt to overcome the
                    various challenges in my programming projects. That's how I knew I could take up this
                    career and thrive. I am currently searching for career opportunities and am really 
                    excited for what awaits!
